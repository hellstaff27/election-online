This project is an online-resource for voting and elections. 
============================================================

 + This resource is a full version of the site for online voting and elections. The project has a flattering design (finalization of the design in the process) and high-quality encryption using CSRF (in the next versions of the project we will add blockchain encryption).
 
 + It is relevant because humanity does not have a single safety online voting system for its countries.
  
 
   Starting server from command line:
   > python manage.py runserver
   
   > start http://127.0.0.1:8000
   
   > now server's running on local ip
 
  
  The project is located on a local server temporarily: in the future, it should have its own data center with reliable protection against DoS and DDoS attacks.
  
  Project is under development. Wait for your offers.
