# election-online
This project is an online-resource for voting and elections. 
============================================================

 + This resource is a full version of the site for online voting and elections. The project has a flattering design (finalization of the design in the process) and high-quality encryption using CSRF (in the next versions of the project we will add blockchain encryption).
 
 + It is relevant because humanity does not have a single online voting system for its countries.
  
 
   Starting from command line:
